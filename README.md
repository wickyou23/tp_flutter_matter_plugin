# tp_flutter_matter_package

>Note: My project is developing. It supports ios to pair Matter Wifi (OnNetwork) and basic control devices. The project uses a Linux device, so it does not test with the real device yet.

1. From the root project, run `sh ./bootstrap.sh` script to download the chip library for iOS(.xcframework) and Android(.so).
2. `flutter pub get` and go to the example folder and `flutter run` the demo project.
