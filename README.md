# tp_flutter_matter_package

My project is developing. It supports ios to pair Matter Wifi, Matter Thread, and basic control devices.

1. From the root project, run `sh ./bootstrap.sh` script to download the chip library for iOS(.xcframework) and Android(.so).
2. `flutter pub get` and go to the example folder and `flutter run` the demo project.
