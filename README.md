# tp_flutter_matter_package

My project is developing. It supports ios to pair Matter Wifi, Matter Thread, and basic control devices.

1. From the root project, run bootstrap.sh script to download the chip library for iOS(.xcframework) and Android(.so).
2. Go to the example folder and run the demo project.
